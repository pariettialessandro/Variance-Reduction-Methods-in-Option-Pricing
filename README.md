# Variance-Reduction-Methods-in-Option-Pricing
• Implemented pricing models for European, Asian, and Barrier options using Geometric Brownian Motion. 
• Applied Antithetic Variates and Control Variates, achieving a Variance Reduction Factor (VRF) of up to 50x. 
• Used Importance Sampling with exponential tilting to price rare-event Knock-In Barrier options and Asian options.

• Project Report: Includes an in-depth analysis of the variance reduction techniques, mathematical proofs, and the full integral version of the code with detailed comments.

• Presentation Slides: A concise overview of the project, ideal for a quick understanding of the core concepts. The slides feature:

  • Theoretical intuition behind Antithetic Variates, Control Variates and Importance Sampling. 
  • A breakdown of the Importance Sampling approach for rare events. 
  • Key code snippets to illustrate the implementation logic without browsing the entire repository.
