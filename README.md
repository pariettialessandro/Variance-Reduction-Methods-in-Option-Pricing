# Variance-Reduction-Methods-in-Option-Pricing
• Implemented pricing models for European, Asian, and Barrier options using Geometric Brownian Motion. • Applied Antithetic Variates and Control Variates, achieving a Variance Reduction Factor (VRF) of up to 50x. • Used Importance Sampling with exponential tilting to price rare-event Knock-In Barrier options and Asian options.
